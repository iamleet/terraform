# Terraform
Messing around with Terraform, getting the hang of the app use. Software Defined Networks are the answer to managing complex infrastructure. Let's flex a little for the audience.

# Example.tf
Contains the configuration to use for provisioning.

## Providers
This example is currently using one provider but will expand to use several as a more complete proof of concept is adapted.
_[Providers List can be found here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html)_


# Benefits
* Manage users on the entire infrastructure and related apps from one spot.
